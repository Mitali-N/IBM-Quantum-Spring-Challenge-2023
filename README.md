# IBM-Quantum-Spring-Challenge-2023
Implementation of Dynamic circuits on Qiskit

This repository contains notebooks for all the 4 labs required to complete the challenge + the 5<sup>th</sup> Bonus Lab.

- Lab 1 - Introduction to Dynamic Circuits
- Lab 2 - Quantum Teleportation 
- Lab 3 - Iterative Phase Estimation
- Lab 4 - Error Correction
- Lab 5 (Bonus Lab) - Using 127 Qubits

Note: Few cells were re-run after the challenge was over, hence some of them show 'INVALID_QUERY' or 'Provider not defined' errors.
